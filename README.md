A full stack web app designed to be a stock trading platform

Note: npm install will have to be run both in the root folder and the client folder.

Other notes: The update button works far more slowly than purchasing or selling.
Refreshing the dashboard/portfolio page visually reverts any changes made prior to it first being loaded. Using any of the buttons
besides logout returns the proper information.
